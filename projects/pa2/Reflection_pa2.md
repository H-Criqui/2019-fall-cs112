##Reflection Pa2

The best part of this assignment was recalling and re-researching all of the things I forgot over the past few months. It all came back quickly but was still a bit troublesome. Using getline and file IO again, was fun and somewhat relaxing for me. 

The assignment itself wasnâ€™t all that difficult. The most important thing a student can remember about coding for this assignment, would be to use their resources. (I.E. stack exchange, google, etc.) knowing how to use getline to read a full file would also be useful. 

The assignment was a little short, especially for something that we had over a week to do. I was able to finish it within the lab period alone. Maybe lengthening it a bit, adding one or two more aspects to the assignment. Adjusting the due date to be sooner might also work. This would have the added benefit of giving us more time on the next assignment.
